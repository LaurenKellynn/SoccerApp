# NWSL Fantasy Soccer League App (Under Development)

Welcome to our NWSL Fantasy Soccer League App project! This app is being built using Java in Android Studio. Our goal is to create a platform where users can form their own fantasy soccer teams from the NWSL (National Women's Soccer League).

## Planned Features

Here's what we're planning for our app:

- **User Registration and Login:** We aim to provide a feature where users can create their own account and keep their teams saved across all devices.
- **Team and Player Selection:** The goal is to allow users to choose from real-life NWSL teams and players to create their dream team.
- **Point Tracking:** We plan to implement a system where players earn points based on their real-life performance.
- **Rankings and Leaderboard:** We want to give users the ability to see how their team stacks up against others in the league.

These features are currently under development. We'll update this README as progress is made and features are completed.
